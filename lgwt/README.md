# Learn Go with Tests

[See the site for Learn Go with Tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/)

## Reasoning 

I chose to start here as it was recommended to me by a friend and because I saw it in a youtube video that suggested getting started with go. 

## Fundamentals 

### Installing Go

[See how to do the install here](https://go.dev/doc/install). The linux guide was pretty easy which is nice. just had to unzip the zip and add some stuff to my bashrc

### Running code 
`go run hello.go`

### Running tests
`go test`

### Documentation 

SEe more on `godoc` here [on the site](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/go-fundamentals/hello-world#go-doc)
